<b> The purpose of our reseach site is to put forth new ideas, theories, speculation
 and articles that in some way may reflect or connect to the Wicocomico Indian 
 Nation and the Powhatan Empire. At no time will we attempt to analyze the Indians
 mind 400 hundred years later, we will deal in facts that may lead to an itelligent
 conclusion or theory. The problem today is that many historians try to reconstruct
 the Indian's mind set based on the training they received in todays world, this is not 
 the way to build a solid base of past history. The prehistoric Indian's mind set,and 
 world view can not possibly be reconstructed  by  contemporary white people with 
 their mind set and world view. 
 </p>
 <p>
 What is amazing is that more historians do not research contemporary Native American
 Tribes literature, religion, folk lore, and oral history to make rational conclusions
 concerning the past. In almost all available information on contemporary Native Americans,
 they all have many things in common, their close relationship to Mother Earth, fire, water
 wind, the four directions, the circle, and other symbols of their past. This is their 
 culture that has  been passed down from their ancestors. Many of these symbols 
 are discussed in the history written by the Europeans 400-500 years ago, a clear 
 indication that, our contempoary Native American Indians continue to have a different
 world view than the white race, a strong desire to keep and maintain their heritage.
 </p>
 <p>
 The articles that we place on our site  are in no way implying that the subject
 matter is part  of our  history or connected to the Wicocomico Indian Nation 
 in any way, but simply stated, an area of research that runs parallel with our 
 research and subject matter may have covered  areas that we  previously researched.

 The following article is submitted by Wayne Winkler, a well known resercher in
 the origins of the "Melungeons" a group of people that are older than America.
 Some of his  research and therories include the role and connections the Powhatan's

 <p align="center">MULUNGEON ORIGINS<br></p>
 <p align="center">By Wayne Winkler</p>
 
 
 For more than a century, the Melungeons have been the focus of anthropologists,
 social scientists, and (especially) feature writers for newspapers and magazines.
 The most common adjective used to describe the Melungeons is "mysterious;" no one
 seems to know where the Melungeons orginated. More significantly, the Melungeions 
 did not fit into any of the racial categories which define an individual or group
 within American society, they were considered by their neighbors neither white,black,
 nor Indian.
 </p>
 <p>
 The Melungeons are a group of mixed ethnic ancestry, found primarily in northeastern
 Tennessee, southwestern Virginia, southeastern Kentucky. Similiar groups of "mysterious"
 people, or at least remnants of these groups, are found all along the Atlantic seaboard.
 While these other groups have no known connection to the Melungeons, they have suffered
 similar problems due to the difficulty of placing them within an established racial
 category. Anthropologists called them "racial islands" or "tri-racial isolates."
 </p>
 <p>
 Several surnames are associated with the Melungeons, including Collins, Gibson, Goins,
 Mullins, Bowlin. The Melungeons have historically been associated with Newmans Ridge in
 Hancock County, Tennessee. Newspapers and magazines have found the Melungeons a 
 fascinating topic since the 1840s, but the Melungeons have resented most of the 
 publicity they have received over the years. Most of the articles on the Melungeons
 speculated on the legends, folklore, and other theories surrounding their ancestry.
 </p>
 <p>
 Some of these legends and theories have suggested descent from Spanish or Portuguese
 explorers, from the "Lost Colonists" of Roanoke Island, from the shipwrecked sailors 
 or pirates of various nationalities, from one of the Lost Tribes of Israel, or from 
 ancient Phoenicians or Carthaginians. More recent theories have proposed that the
 Melungeons descended from Mediterranean or Middle Eastern ancestors.
 </p>
 <p>
 None of these theories originated with the Melungeons themselves. Early accounts 
 reflect the Melungeons' self description as "Indians." Some Melungeons reportedly
 described themselves a Portuguese," or,  as many pronounced it, Portyghee."Most
 of their white neighbors considered the Melungeons a mixture of black and Indian
 or white, black, and Indian.
 </p>
 <p>
 There is no consistent definition of the word "Melungeon." Some anthropologists
 have limited the term to a few families located near Newman's Ridge, while others
 have expanded "Melungeon" to include other mixed-race groups in the southeastern
 United States. At one time, the word was used as a racial epithet against a 
 mullatto, at another time as a political epithet for east Tennessee Republicans.
 The common usage of the term had an element of socio-economic status attached to it;
 families who were financially successful were not necessarily considered Melungeon,
 no matter  who their ancestors were.
 </p>
 <p>
 By the early 1960s, newspaper articles predicted the disappearance of the Melungeons;
 out-migration and intermarriage with whites had nearly rendered the  Melungeons
 indistinguishable from their white neighbors. However, by the end of that decade, 
 Melungeons in Hancock County were acknowledging and celebrating their heritage
 with an outdoor drama. By the mid-1900s, a "virtual community" of Melungeons had
 developed on the internet.
 </p>
 <p>
 One question which has been examined by nearly every writer on this subject is 
 the origin of the name"Melungeon" The most commonly accepted theory is that
 the word derived fromthe French <i>melange,</i> meaning mixture. A French colony
 in southwestern Viginia in the late 1700s may have dubbed these people with the 
 plural form of <i> melange</i>, which is <i> melangeon</i> or <i>melangeons,</i>
 which could conceivably have been corrupted to "Melungeon." Another proposed theory
 for the origin of "Melungeon" is the Afro-Portuguese term meaning <i> melungo,</i>
 supposedly meaning shipmate." Yet another is the Greek term <i> melan,</i> meaning
 "black."
 </p>
 <p>
 Author Brent Kennedy, in arguing a Trukish origin for the Melungeons, maintains that
 "Melungeons" derives from the Arabic <i>melun jinn</i>and the Turkish<i>melun can,</i>
 both pronounced similarly to " Melungeon" and both translated to "cursed soul" "or one
 who has been abandoned by God."Kennedy maintains that the Melungeons identified themselves
 by that name.
 </p>
 <p>
 Historian C.S.Everett suggests another possible origin for the term:<i>melongena,</i>
 originally an Italian term related to the more modern <i>melanzane</i>(pronounced meh
 lun zhen eh) which means "eggplant." The eggplant has a dark skin,and the term was 
 used to describe sub-Saharan Africans.
 </p>
 <p>
 Karlton Douglas and Joanne Pexxullo suggests that the word "Melungeon" originated as
 the old English term "malengin"(singular) or "malengine"(plural). An old copy of Webster's
 Dictionary defines "malengine" as "Evil machination; guile;deceit. Douglas and Pessullo
 write, "It is well known the people of Appalachia, and Melungeons in particular, used
 words that were becoming archaic, and not much in use beyond Appalachia."
 </p>
 <p>
 Nearly everyone that has written about the Melungeons agrees that they fiercely resented
 the name. Even in mid-20th century, to call a Hancock Countian a Melungeon was to 
 insult him. The stigma attached to the name "Melungeon" leads most researchers to the 
 conclusion that the name was imposed upon the people, that it was not a name they 
 ever used for themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
 Most Melungeons in Hancock County lool very much like their "white" neighbors, many 
 of whom are quite swarthy from a lifetime of outdoor work. In 1963, Brewton Berry
 wrote,"[N]either in their culture nor their economy are they distinguishable from other
 mountain folk. Among those bearing the telltale surnames are individuals of dark
 complexion and straight black hair...But the physical features of most of them suggest
 no other ancestry than white."
 	Some historic descriptions of Melungeons include:	
</p>
<p>
<font size="2">
They are tall, straight, well-formed people, of a dark
copper color...but wolly heads and other similar appendages of our negro.
</p>
<p>
They are swarthy complexion, with prominent cheek bones, jet black hair, generally 
straight but at times having a slight tendancy to curl, and the men have heavy black
beards...Their frames are well built and some of the men are fine specimens of 
physical manhood. They are seldom fat.
</p>
<p>
While some of them are swarthy and have high Indian cheekbones, the mountain whites,
too, often display these same characteristics. Also, many of the Melungeons have 
light hair, blue eyes, and fair skin.
</p>
<p>
The color of the skin of a full-blooded, pure Melungeon is a much richer  brown
than an Indian's skin. It is not the color of a part Indian and part white, for 
their skin is lighter. The full-blooded, pure Melungeon had more the color of a
skin of a person from India and Egypt.
