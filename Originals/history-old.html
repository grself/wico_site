ENGLISH ARRIVAL: SCOUTING FOR A SETTLEMENT<b>
After an earlier skirmish with the Indians at Cape Henry, the three
boats entered the James River on or about May 4th, 1607. After scouting the river
the English found the place they thought  was a suitable on May 13th 1607, an 
island in Pasaheagh country  without native habitation. The island could easily
be defended and with sufficient deep water near the shore to tie down the three
ships. However near by was a mosquito infested swamp, and the water in the James 
turned brackish during the summer months. It wasn't until later they realized 
the mistake.

<p>
CAPT JOHN SMITH'S EXPLORATION  OF THE MD AND VA EASTERN SHORE.JUNE 2-JULY 21, 1608.
<blockquote>" Passing along the coast searching every inlet and bay fit for harbor and
habitations...seeing many isles in the midst of the bay, we bore up for them. But
ere we could obtain them, such an extreme gust of wind, rain, thunder, and lighting
happened that with great danger we escaped unmerciful raging of that ocean like water.
The highest land on the main, yet it was but low, we called Keale's Hill,<b>
and these uninhabited isles Russell's Isles.
<p/>
<p>
The next day, searching for fresh water, we could find none; the defect whereof forced
us to follow the next eastern  channel, which brought us to the WIGHCOCOMOCO.The people
at first with great fury seemed to assault us, yet at last with songs and dances and much
mirth became very tractable. But searching their habitations for water, we could fill 
but three barricoes, and that such puddle (muddy water) that never till then we ever   
knew the want of water. We digged in and searched in many places, but before two days 
were expired we would have refused two barricoes of gold for one of that puddle water of
WIGHCOCOMOCO.</blockquote>

<p>
Smith's exploration took place in what we know today as Maryland and Virginia, on the
east side of Chesapeake Bay. In Maryland Smith encountered the Maryland Wicocomico.Based on 
recent research, the Maryland Wicocomico and Virginia Wicocomico may be connected.
This possibility is discussed in later chapters.

CAPT SMITH'S SECOND EXPEDITION: VIRGINIA SHORE JULY 24-SEPTEMBER 7, 1608.
<blockquote>" In the discovery of the Rappahannock River, they were kindly received 
by the people of Maraughacund. Here they met an old friend and acquaintance, one
<i>MOSCO,</i> a lusty <i>INDIAN OF WIGHCOCOMOCE (WICOCOMICO)</i>on the River Patomack
(Potomac). They supposed him some Frenchman's son because of his thick black
bushy beard, and the Indians seldom have any at all. And he was not a little proud of
this, and to see so many of his countrymen. He was very offcious and useful to the 
English; they advised them by all means not to pass over to Rappahanocks who would 
certainly kill them for being friends with the Maraughacunds, who had lately stolen three 
of their King's women. But thinking, he only said this to secure their trade to his friends,
they crossed the river to the Rappahanocks.There under the pretence of trade, they were 
invited up to Rappahanock Creek, where they had laid an ambush, and after a smart skirmish
in which many Indians were slain and wounded, the English came off the victors without the
least hurt. Having driven them into the woods, they seized three or four canoes, full of
commodities, which with some arrows, they ahd gathered up, they presented to MOSCO for
his kindness. Under he on his part, received them in the most triumphant manner,and
in martial Order Under Arms, that he could procure of the Maraughaacunds".

located on the Patawomek River (Potomac River). The actual location of the Wicocomico
village was at the end and slightly north of the Little Wicomico River. According to 
Stephen Potter, the Wicocomico King's village was at the end and slightly north of the
Little Wicomico River and his subjects had a village close to the mouth and south of the 
Little Wicomico called Cinquck. This is the first mention of the Wicocomico.
</p>
<p>
One has to question the validity of this expedition being his first on the shores of 
Virginia. His comments  about meeting "Mosco" an old friend from the Wighcocomoco
tends to imply they were acquainted before, indication that he had made some type of
trip through the area prior to this expedtion.
</p>
<p>
Smith also mentioned that Mosco was thought to be part French because of his thick
black beard. I personally believe that Mosco is part Spanish. One has to keep
in mind that the Spanish were in the area in 1525 and later. My personal thoughts 
on the influence of the Spanish in the area will be discussed in a separate chapter.
</p>
<p>
The following is an excerpt from the "History of the Discovery and Settlement 
of Virginia" by William Stith one of the Governors of William and Mary College.
<blockquote>"At this time also Captain Raleigh Croshaw was in the Patowmack River
(Potomac River) trading in a small bark, commanded by Capt Spilman. There an Indian 
stole aboard and told them of the massacre, (1622) and that Opechancanough had been
practicing with his King and Country to betray them, which they refused to do, but
that the Indians of WIGHCOCOMOCO ( WICOCOMICO) had undertaken it. Hereon Captain 
Spilman went thither, but they feeling his men so vigilant and well armed, suspected 
themselves to be discovered, therefore, the better to colour their guilt, and delude
him, they gave him such satisfaction in his trade, that his vessel was soon near loaded".
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
To sum it up, the WIGHCOCOMOCO (Wicocomico) were turned in by some unknown Indian,
in turn Spilman went to the Wighcocomoco camp. The Wighcocomoco understood that they were 
suspect of planning to participate in the 1622 uprising. They traded so well  with Spilman,
preventing an attack on their village.
</p>
<p>
The following paragraph (William Strachey 1609-1612) discusses the Wighcocomoco and
the population of the Wighcocomoco and other tribes on the Potomac River.
<blockquote>"The fourth river is called Patawomeck (Potomac) and we called it Elizabeth
River, and is six or seven miles breadth. It is navigable 120 miles, and is fed as
the rest with many sweet rivers and springs which fall from the bordering hills. Many
of them are planted and yield no less plenty and variety fo fruit than the other rivers.
It exceedeth with abundance of fish, and is inhabited on both side: First on the south
side at the very entrance is the WIGHCOCOMOCO,and which hath 130 fighting men; beyond
that is Cekakawon with 30 men; then Onawmanient with 100 men; then Patawomeck with 160
able men".
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Several formulas were developed by historians to determine the population of a village.
some used a multiplier of 3 1/2, others used 4. The most common multiplier used for 
the Wighcocomoco, was 4, making the total  tribal strength at 520. the Wighcocomoco
was one of the largest tribes in Virginia at that time.
</p> 
<p>
WIGHCOCOMOCO, 1650 TO 1719
</p>
<p>
The 1622 incident concerning the confrontation with the Wighcocomoco Tribe is the last
mention of the Wighcocomoco until Northumberland become a county in 1648. Previously
the area of the Wicocomico Indians remained in the hands of local Indians, although 
there were excursions by the English into the area. After the English discovered 
the potential of the area, they immediately annexed the area as Northumberland County.
The original boundaries were located between the Potomac and the Rappahannock Rivers and
the western boundaries were open for expansion in the future. In 1651 Lancaster County
was formed from a section of Northumberland.
</p>
<p>
The Virginia General Assembly passed a law in 1652 that authorized 50 acres per bowman.
Northumberland County complied with this order by directing, Machymap ( Werowance of 
the Cekacawon and Wicocomico Indians.) to have his land surveyed. This indicates that
sometimes between 1652 and 1655 the previously seperate tribes (Wicocomico and
Cekacawon) were directed by the Northumberland Assembly, to merge as one single entity.
Also during this period both tribes were relocated to the south of the Great Wicoccomico
River, whereas  previously the Cekacawon were located near the Coan River and the 
Wicocomico at the end and slightly north of the Little Wicomico.
</p>
<p>
The survey in 1655/56 by Gervais Dodson surveyed 4,400 acres near Dividing Creek
for the merged tribes. There is a strong possibility  the Cuttatawomen Tribe merged 
with the Wicocomico and Cekacawon between 1656/59 (Helen Rountree). Supposedly the
Cuttatawomen were reported to have been moving toward the north in the direction of
the Wicocomico at their new lands. The Cuttatawomen as a tribe dropped out of existence
and were never heard of again.
</p>
<p>
Machywap was selected as the Werowance ( by the English) of the combined Wicocomico
and Cekacawon, because he was considered a friend and easy to manage. This selection
did not go well with the Wicocomico, they wanted their person as the leader.The conflict 
was so great that Machywap's life was threatened to the point that the English had to
provide protection for him. By 1660 the merged tribes were called the Wicocomico and
settled in their new lands of 4,400 acres. However this did not last long, shortly 
after the Wicocomico were relocated, their new lands were being encroached on by the 
English, supposedly Samuell Mathewes( former governor) had previously been issued a
grant for the same land that had been surveyed for the Wicocomico.Between 1660 and
1673 the whites and the Wicocomico were constantly in court battling over land disputes.
Finally in 1673 the disputes were resolved in favor of the Wicocomico and the 1655
boundaries reestablished. However, even though the disputes were in favor of the 
Wicocomico, by 1719 approximately 1,700 of the 4,400 acres were left, the land  had
been given out as grants by the English even though the Wicocomico had been forced
to relocate from their original ancestral near the Little Wicocomico River  in 1652.
</p>
<p>
Begining with Machywap, the Northumberland Commissioners(1655 to 1719)appointed 
the successors to the position of Werowance. However the Wicocomico refused to 
cooperate.Pewem apparently was selected by the tribe as Chief, however the English
did not recognize him as such and addressed him as "Great Man". With this control by
the county commissioners and the law passed by the English that stated that if a 
tribe deserted their lands the English could move in and confiscate the land; these two
acts effectively destroyed the tribes as an independent political entity. 
</p>
<p>
The last recognized colonial Tribal Chief was "King William Taptico".(visit our 
"Chief" web page for known list of Wicocomico Tribal Chiefs). Willian died in 1719;
after his death, his wife, Elizabeth settled his estate. At the onset of settling
William's estate, Elizabeth began the process by signing the documentation as
"Elizabeth Taptico and completed the process by signing "Elizabeth Tapp".
</p>
<p>
THIS IS THE BEGINING OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN TAPPS.
</p>
<p>
Current Wicocomico family names are,Taptico/Tapp, Veazey/Vesey, Mosco, Nordas,
Roberts and possibly Curtis.

The area inhabited by tribes of the Powhatan Empire depended on the waterways
for transportation and some of their food supplies. The most popular method of
transportation was the canoe. A fire was built around the base of a tree to weaken the tree
and then toppled. After the limbs were trimmed, a fire was built on the log to 
char the area that was to be dug out. The primary tool used for the removel 
of charred wood was a large shell.

Image two represents the type of clothes worn by women. The apron type
apparel consisted of various materials, depending on the wealth of the
person. Aprons were made of animal hides and various grasses(called 
silk grass). Normally waist up the women were bare other than adornments
of some type. Hair styles varied from tribe to tribe, some wore bangs, 
others cut their hair to ear level, others  wore their hair pulled back.Again it
depended on the tribe affiliation.

Image three indicate how the mothers carried their children and was described by
Robert Beverley in his book "The History And Present State of Virginia", written in
1705 and is one of the earliest comprehensive works done. According to Beverley, the 
children were kept on a hard board until their bones begin to harden. They were removed
and allowed to play, but most of the time was spent on the board. Another custom that
was foreign to the English; each morning the child was dipped in cold water.

The images are generic and are considered to be the type of clothing and other every day
activities practiced by the tribes of the Powhatan Confederacy. The images are etchings by
De Bry, sometimes in the earlier 1600s. The coloring was added recently.

<B>TAPTICO-TAPP</B>
<P>
This section gives a brief  history outline of the connection between King William
Taptico and the Tapps, included is the first four generations of William Taptico and
when they begin using the name,Tapp
</p>
<p>
After King William Taptico, the last hereditary Tribal Chief of the Wicocomico died,
the English did not appoint a successor, nor did a descendant of Taptico take over
reign of the tribe. Taptico's wife Elizabeth, settled his estate, (which was substantial)
and began the process by signing the documents as Elizabeth Taptico,and completed the process
by signing Elizabeth Tapp.This appears to be the period in time when the Indian Tapps came
into being.Currently we do not have proof if Elizabeth was English or Indian.
The book,"Tapp Family of America" stated that she was English but did not offer proof.
During this period it was against English law for Indians and whites to marry, so there is
doubt that Elizabeth was English.

The  above lineage is verified and will give the visitor a good solid foundation to
start his/her research.
</p>  


<p>
Extant records of Northumberland County VA indicate that other Wicocomico family names are,
Veazey, Curtis, Mosco, Nordas, and possibly Roberts.
</p>
<p>
Other major family lines in the earlier Taptico/Tapp lineage are; Bourne,
Dogget,Fowler, Boch, Jett, and Wright.
