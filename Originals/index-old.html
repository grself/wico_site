"TAPTICO" LAST OF THE WICOMICO....<font size="2"><font color="red"> The book is now ready...the cost is $48 which <br>incudes the cost 
of mailing. The book is well formatted for easy locating your ancestors. The book traces the 
 Native American Taptico/Tapp lineage from 1678 to the 5th and 6th and 7th generation. For those that buy the book
 will receive all future research on the Native American Tapps free of charge. I currently have many of the 
 Tapps identified up to the 1930s,50s however  The book is appr 380 pages.<br> For those that buy the book and you are 
 a descendant of King William Taptico, you will receive a certificate that states that you are a member of the Wicomico
 Tribe.<br>
 Previously the system that we had was 
 cumbersome, we received an application then we attempted to determine if the person was a descendant, with the book
 a person should be able to determine immeadiately if they are descendants.  In the event that you are an adopted Tapp
 this is not a problem. Two things that the Bureau of Indian Affairs has made clear, DNA is not required and if you were
 adopted by a Tapp family that is of Indian lineage you will be accepted, however let me make it clear, the person
 applying for membership in the tribe must prove that he/she was adopted.If the adoption took place in the 1880s and 
 1700s, adoption papers are not available in most cases, if this is the case, a complete lineage must be forwarded.<br>
 COMMENTS CONCERNING THE BOOK HAVE BEEN FAVORABLE, AND EASY TO READ.

Chamah  Netab ( Welcome Friend) <br> we are in the process of selecting council members in order to bring the tribe
back to life. The Council will  be structured more to the times and  designed to make decisions quickly. Our primary 
and number  one project will be to seek State Approval in Virginia, much of this work has previousley been
completed......... we previously submitted the first book of the Wicocomico History to indian Affairs, the second book 
will be submitted with a copy of the first book, to the State of Virginia. Some of our previous projects included
build a Culture center, issuance of a stamp honoring King William Taptico, (this was done)  and a time capsule. We did have
approval to erect a monument to the Wicocomico Indians, however the selection appeared to be to restrictive and only
available to a select few. At the time of disbanding the council, we were in the process of having a historical 
marker placed on the road that at one time, part of the Wicocomico land.<br> We welcome any and all 
to apply for membership in the Wicocomico Nation.
