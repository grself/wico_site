<b>TRAIL OF DEATH:</b>after years of researching the Wicocomico Nation, it has led me to 
various other sources of study concerning the brutality  that Native Americans suffered
at the hands of the English and later the United States.These stories will not be found
in our history books and if by some chance one is found in the history books, it will be 
written so that it would be difficult to realize it was the same story. Our children were
brought up on the story of Pocohantas and how understanding the English were.
</p>
<p>
When stories of this nature are read, many people try to make excuses for the brutality
that was imposed on the Native Americans. Many readers will mention the atrocities the 
Native Americans imposed on the English and citizens of the United States.KEEP IN MIND 
THIS LAND BELONGED TO THE NATIVE AMERICANS; they reacted just as any citizen would in
defense of their land and family.
</p>
<p>
When Indians came in contact with the Europeans ( Spanish,French,English) it was a 
disaster for the Indians in the form of out right slaughter, or through diseases 
which the Indians were not immune to. I believe that is sufficient enough to make the 
Indians wary of the Europeans.
</p>
<p>
When the English arrived to settle Jamestown, Chief Powhatan fed and kept the English
alive, however after a short time it was evident the intent of the English was to 
steal the land in any manner possible.
</p>
<p>
<b>MILITARY CAMPAIGN AGAINST POWHATAN</b>
</p>
<p>
During the summer of 1610 in Jamestown, the Governor, Thomas West De la Warr had 
directed Powhatan to return several runaway Englishman. It appears  Powhatan did
not respond in a satisfactory manner. De la Warr felt this was sufficient reason to
conduct a military campaign against Powhatan. George Percy, brother to the Earl of
Northumberland and De la Warr's second in command headed up the military action against 
Powhatan. The following is Percy's description of the actions that took place;
</p>
<p>
Drawing my soldiers into battle, placing a Captain or Lieutenant at every file,
we marched towards the Indian Town...and then we fell upon them, put some fifteen or
sixteen to the sword and almost the rest to flight...My Lieutenant brought with him 
the Queen and her children and one Indian prisoner for which I taxed him because he
had spared them. His answer was that having them now in custody I might do with them 
what I pleased. Upon the same I caused the Indians head to be cut off, then disperesed 
my files, appointing my soldiers to burn their houses and to cut down their corn growing
about the town. With the Indians dead or disperesed, their village destroyed, and their
food supplies laid to waste, Percy sent out another raiding party to the the same to 
another Indian Town and then marched to his boats with the Queen and her children in tow.
There, however his soldiers "did begin to murmur because the Queen and her children were
spared." This seemed a reasonable complaint to Percy, so he called a council together and
"it was agreed upon to putt the children to death <b>THE WHICH WAS EFFECTED BY THROWING
THEM OVERBOARD, SHOOTING OUT THEIR BRAINS IN THE WATER."</b> Upon his return to Jamestown, 
however, Percy was informed that Governor De la Warr was unhappy with him because he had not 
yet killed the Queen. Advised by his chief Lieutenant that it would be best to burn her 
alive, Perry instead decided to end his day of "so much bloodshed" with a final act of
mercy:instead of burning her, he had the queen quickly killed by stabbing her to death.
</p>
<p>
<b>JAMESTOWN LEGISLATION AGAINST THE INDIANS</b>
</p>
<p>
In 1623, the Jamestown Colonists passed legislation that indicated their hostility
toward the Indians. The following acts are those that deal with the Indians.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Act 23: " that every dwelling house shall be pallizaded in for
defence against the Indians.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Act 24: "that no man go or send abroad without a sufficient party 
well armed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Act 25: "that men go not towork in the ground with out their arms
(and a centenell upon them).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Act 26: "that the inhabitants go not aboard ships or upon any other
occasions in such numbers, as thereby to weaken and endanger the plantations.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Act 27: "that the commander of every plantation take care that
there be sufficient powder and ammunition within the plantation under his command
and their pieces fixt and their arms complete.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Act 29: "that no commander of any plantation do either him-selfe
or suffer others to spend powder unnecessarily in drinking or entertainments.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Act 32:<b>"that at the beginning of July next the inhabitants of
every corporation shall fall upon their adjoining savages, as we did last year,
those that shall be hurt upon services, to be cured at the public charge; in case
any to be lamed to  be maintained by the country according to his person and quality.</b>
</p>
<p>
Finally in 1655 the legislatures first act for that session was to pass an Act in the 
Indians favor. The Assembly admitted they were harsh on the Indians and they had 
attacked the white man to protect their land and way of life. The first Act: for every
eight wolves heads the Indian brought in, the Great Man would receive a cow. The second
Act: if the Indian families would bring in their children to live with a white family,
the children would be educated and civilized and not be used as slaves. The third Act:
it addressed the Indians land in that he could not bargin away his land to an Englishman 
without the permission of the Assembly, and his land was protected from unfair seizure.
</p>
<p>
Based on the treatment the English inflicted on the Powhatans when they arrived in 1608,the 
colonists, after the Revolutionary War continued the same methods that had served the 
English so well as indicated in the following stories as the United States moved west.
</p>
<p>
<b>SAND CREEK MASSACRE (SE COLORADO)</b>.
</p>
<p>
In 1864 Col Chivington ( a former clergyman that had political ambitions) was
appointed the territorial military commander in Colorado. After some isolated 
incidents with the Indians, Chivington sent out detachments to burn and destroy 
Indian villages, the Cheyenne, Arapahos, Sioux, Kiowa's, and Comanches's struck
back. this give Chivington the opportunity that he was looking for, to launch a full
scale attack on the Indians.
</p>
<p>
On November 29, 1864, Chivington deployed his command, about seven hundred solders
with howitzers around Black Kettle's village on Sand Creek. Black Kettle was under
the impression that he was at peace with the Americans; he ran up the American Flag 
and assured his people that all was well. the troops opened fire and charged. The
Indians scattered in all directions. Chivington had made it clear that he wanted no 
prisoners, hie policy was "to kill and scalp all, little and big". Nits make lice
he was fond of saying. Interpreter John Smith later testified: they were scalped, 
their brains knocked out; the men used their knives, ripped open women, clubbed 
little children, knocked them in the head with their guns, beat their brains out,
mutilated their bodies in every sense of the word. Two hundred Cheyenne's, two
thirds of them women and children perished. Nine chiefs died, however Chief Black
Kettle escaped.( Only to  be murdered later by Custer.)
</p>
<p>
<b>WOUNDED KNEE</b>
</p>
<p>
About a week prior to the slaughter at Wounded Knee, <b>L.Frank Baum,</b> editor of
South Dakota's Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer newspaper advocated the extermination
of all America's Indians. <b>Quote;</b> The nobility of the Redskin is extinquished
and what few are left are a pack of whining curs who lick the hand that smites them.
The whites by law of conquest, by justice of civilization, are masters of the American 
continent, and the best safety of the frontier settlements will be secured by the total 
annihilation of the few remaining Indians.(<b>WHY NOT ANNIHILATION?)</b>Their  glory has
fled, their spirit broken, their manhood effaced, better they should die than live
the miserable wretches that they are. Unquote.<b>L. FRANK BAUM LATER BECOMES FAMOUS AS
THE AUTHOR OF: </b>  
</p>
<p><b><h2>"THE WIZARD OF OZ."
</h2>
</b>
</p>
<p>
An Indian named American Horse, who had been friendly to the American troops for years
gave this narrative of the slaughter at Wounded Knee; "they turned their guns, Hotchkiss
guns upon the women who were in  the lodges standing there under a flag of truce, and of
course as soon as they were fired upon they fled...There was a women with an infant in her 
arms who was killed as she almost touched the flag of truce, and the women and children
of course were strewn all along the circular village untill they were dispatched. Right
near the flag of truce a mother was shot down with her infant; the child not knowing that
it's mother was dead was still nursing, and that especially was a very sad sight.The women
as they were fleeing with their babies were killed together, shot right through, and the
women who were heavy with child were also killed...After most of them had been killed a 
cry was made that all those who were not killed or wounded should come forth and they would
be safe. Little boys who were not wounded came out of their places of refuge, and as
soon as they came in sight,<b> a number of soldiers surrounded them and butchered them there...
</b>Of course it would have been alright if only the men were killed; we would feel almost 
grateful for it. But the fact of the killing of the women and more especially of the
of the young boys and girls who are to go to make up the future of the Indian people,
is the saddest part of the whole affair and we feel it very sorely." Unquote"

Shortly after the massacre, Baum stated his approval, in the "Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer's
paper stating that; we had better, in order to protect our civilization, follow it up
and wipe these untamed and untameable creatures from the face of the earth.

NEW ENGLAND COLONY
<p>
On May 26th 1635 in Connecticut, Captain John Mason with his Massachusetts-Connecticut
force of ninty men and eighty Mohegans and 500 Narragansett Indians planned to attack
the Pequot with the intent to completly wipe the town out.  Mason and his militia 
struck in the predawn. Mason instructed his men to not take any prisoners.
When the Mohegans and Narragansett  found out about the no prisoner order they refused to
participate and left.
Thus left to his own devices, Mason ordered his miltiamen to set fire
to the entire town, burning alive as many as 900 "women, children, and 
helpless old men. Those who tried to escape the blaze were cut down with 
swords and axes. As Plymouth Governor William Bradford later described the 
scene, paraphrasing Mason's own exultant account: <br><h4> "It was  a fearful sight to see 
them thus frying  in the fire and the streams of blood quenching the same, and 
horrible was the stink and scent thereof; but the victory seemed a sweet
sacriface, and they gave  the praise thereof to God, who had wrought
so wonderfully  for them, thus to enclose their enemies in their hands and
give them so  speedy  a victory over so pround and insulting an enemy.
</h4>

The new England Colony made the Virginia Colonists look like a group of
saints. Indians normally fought out of revenge, to steal women or slaves,
but very seldom slaughtered women and children and old men for land.

What has been disclosed on this site is only the tip of the iceberg, broken treaties 
and promises are part of the Native Americans everyday vocabulary.

I'm sure some folks that read this page will feel uncomfortable, however that was not
the intent. If we forget the past, it will make a circle and repeat it's self. It's 
also important for people to know the truth not only one side, but both. I believe 
a reader will now understand why the Native American feels strongly about their
reservations and treaties with the government. In some parts of the country 
the Native American did not have voting privilages as late as the 1960s, so for them
the past is not in the 1800s, but just a few short years ago.

The Native American is not looking for sympathy, but justice; if any one wants to keep
informed of Native American problems, you can go on the internet www.indiancountry.com
it's a well written paper. Also any comments  or questions may be addressed to
