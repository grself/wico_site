<h2>
Past Tribal Chiefs</h2>
		<p>
During our research of the Taptico and Tapp connection, we  found several names of
past Tribal Chiefs or Great men of the Wicocomico Nation. The list will enter the title
used for that particular period of time.</p>
<p>
From the earliest known leader to the last leader; William Taptico, various titles were
used, and some may have been misinterpreted by the English when recording some action.
</p>
<p>
We will also list names of various Wicocomico Indians that were mentioned. 
Some names may be a clue to a persons Native American Heritage.However keep in mind
that many of the indians changed their Indian names to the name of an English friend, 
or an English employer, or if they were slaves or indentured servants to the names of the
English that owned them.
</p>
<p>We also have to keep in mind of the possibilty that many of the  tribes 
merged with the larger tribes in Virginia and some may have crossed into 
North Carolina and joined the Cherokees. Currently Virginia has  nine tribes
that survived the colonization of Indian land.<i>Chickahominy, Eastern Chickahominy,
Rappahannock, Mattaponi, Upper Mattaponi, Monacan, Nansemond ,Pamunkey and Wicocomico.</i>
</p>
		<p>
As we have stated previously, it is our intent to reestablish the Wicocomico
Indian Nation. There are hundreds of Wicocomico descendants through out 
the United States that were disenfranchised because of the English Colonists
failure to appoint or allow the hereditary heirs take reign of the Wicocomico
Nation when King William Taptico died in 1719. If the natural process had been
allowed to take place, the Wicocomico may very well have remained in existence
with out a break.

		<h3>
		TRIBAL CHIEFS---1655--1719
</h3>
		<p>
		Weroance-------------1655</p>
		<p class="style1">
		Machywap was the first Tribal Chief after the merger of the Sekacawone 
		and Wicocmico.
</p>
		<p>
		Great Men-------------1660
</p>
		<p class="style1">
		Pewem and Owasewas; Pewem was the Tribal Chief of the Wicocomico, but 
		was not recognized as such by the English and considered him as a Great 
		Man. The English in Northumberland had disrupted the normal process of 
		electing the Tribal Chiefs and had taken on the roll of approving 
		authority for all Tribal Chiefs.
</p>
		<p>
		Great Men-------------1662</p>
		<p class="style1">
		Orasonay, Chistecuttewaws and Tatememony
</p>
		<p>
		Great Men-------------1668</p>
		<p class="style1">
		Owasawas, Appenmaw and Chicatomen
</p>
		<p>
		Great Man-------------1678</p>
		<p class="style1">
		Robert; is referred to as &quot;Robert The Great Man&quot;
</p>
		<p>
		Indian King-------------1688</p>
		<p class="style1">
		James Veazey; Appears to be the Father of John Veazey
</p>
		<p>
		Great Man-------------1693
</p>
		<p class="style1">
		William Taptico I; this is the father of William Taptico II, last Tribal 
		Chief.
</p>
		<p>
		Chief Man-------------1713
</p>
		<p class="style1">
		John Veazey; It&#39;s difficult to determine if the English did not 
		understand the council structure or the titles. The English called John 
		Veazey a Chief man, however William Taptico II was called King William 
		Taptico in 1710 when he presented three Indian Arrows as an 
		acknowledgement for the land he and his Nation holds in Northumberland 
		County Virginia.
</p>
		<p>
		King----------------------1710-1719
</p>
		<p class="style1">
		William Taptico II was the last Tribal Chief of the Wicocomico. He died 
		in 1719 and it appears the tribal land was turned over to Phillip Smith, 
		based on a document William Taptico I supposedly signed about 1693.
</p>
		<h3>
		Notes About the Tribal Chiefs</h3>
		<p>
		Other names that were identified other than the above are, Mosco, 
		Nordas,and George Taptico. The Curtis name is connected with the Taptico 
		name in several actions and may be a Wicocomico family name or married 
		into the Taptico family or vice versus. We will make this assumption and 
		research as such.</p>
		<p>
		It also appears that many of the Chiefs and Great Men had taken on 
		English names by the 1670s. One Great man that requires investigating is 
		&quot;Robert the Great Man.&quot; Robert could possibly be another Wicocomico 
		family name. We are not sure where George Taptico fits in our lineage, 
		however it is believed that he may have been William I&#39;s brother; or, if 
		not a brother, then a relative. It would be unlikely that a tribe would 
		have two families with the same name, especially the ruling family.
</p>
		<p>
		If any reader feel they are descendants of the above names , feel free 
		to email.</p>
