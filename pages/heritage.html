		<p>&quot;TAPTICO&quot; LAST OF THE WICOMICO&quot; will be available in October, and 
		will be published on demand. This book will most likely be the last 
		concerning Taptico and the Wicomico UNLESS FURTHER INFORMATION IS FOUND 
		! I hope to take a research trip soon. However at this time, the book 
		will have everything that has been found in my 25 years of researching 
		Tapp and Taptico connection. It will consist of the Wicomico Tribe and 
		Native American Tapp genealogy from their inception...1608 to 1850. </p>
		<p>This book will have copies of documents that will specifically state 
		that William Tapp is the King of the Wicomico, copies of Christian 
		Bourne Tapp&#39;s mark, this was found in a valuable document section in a 
		library and was donated to the library in the late 1920&#39;s, however who 
		donated the document was not revealed. Several pages of exact volumes 
		and pages of Wills, Deeds and other documents in VA concerning the Tapps. </p>
		<p>The book will have a very extensive section on Moses Tapp and 
		supporting documents, this section alone will help those that are 
		researching this family...a large chapter on the English Tapps, this 
		section will help clear up the information that is currently spread thru 
		out the Tapp genealogy. There will also be some very interesting stories 
		about the Tapps. Several family Sections of the &quot;Tapp Family Book&quot; by 
		Liles, Fulcher, Tapp will be cleared up... some folks will be 
		disappointed but at least we will clear up several family trees. </p>
		<p>The book will be about 300 pages plus 2-3 CDs... cost $33.00 
		(shipping included). Contact me at
		<a href="mailto:eagleman1@localnet.com?subject=Contact from the Wico Site">
		eagleman1@localnet.com</a> for ordering and details. </p>
