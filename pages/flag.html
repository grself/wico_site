		<p>WELCOME TO THE HISTORY OF OUR FLAG. In most cases Indian Tribes had 
		banners, flags or a clan symbol that represented their history or 
		affiliation with the elements. Unfortunately the Wicocomico, through out 
		the last three hundred years have lost their original symbolism. What we 
		have done is taken certain information gathered from the history of the 
		Wicocomico and developed the flag.</p>
		<p>Steve Martin, one of our earliest members accepted the task of 
		developing the flag and the meaning of the markings on the flag. </p>
		<p>
		<img align="right" alt="Flag of the Wicocomico Tribe" height="164" hspace="5" src="../images/flag3.jpg" width="268" />The 
		flag of the Wicocomico Indian Nation is filled with symbolism. The red 
		dominant background is symbolic of the Wicocomico people and their 
		Native American lineage. The three blue horizontal bars represent the 
		rivers that bordered and flowed through the Wicocomico homeland of the 
		early 1600s. The top bar is symbolic of the Potomac River that bordered 
		the Wicocomico homeland to the north. The bottom bar is symbolic of the 
		Rappahanock River located to the south of the Wicocomico. The smaller 
		located to the right of center on the flag is symbolic of both the Great 
		Wicocomico River and Little Wicocomico River that flowed through the 
		Wicocomico homeland. The principal village of Wicocomico and lesser 
		village of Cinquack were located on the shores of these two rivers; 
		thus, the shield in the center of the flag is connected to this central 
		blue bar. The shield&#39;s color is symbolic of the bark shields recorded as 
		being used by the tribes of that area. The shield bears two red bars, 
		one black bar and a signature. The red and black colors are the only 
		known colors recorded as being used by the Indians of Virginia&#39;s 
		Northern neck. During times of war, men would paint their bodies 
		half-red and half-black(horizontally or vertically).It was also recorded 
		that they painted their shields in like manner or painted three bars on 
		their shields of red and black color. The signature located on the 
		shield is of special significance. This is the signature/mark of William 
		Taptico, Jr., last Weroance of the Wicocomico. William Taptico, Jr was 
		the son of William Taptico, Sr. a Great Man of the Wicocomico and likely 
		a Weroance himself. William Taptico, Jr. died 1719 and was survived by 
		his wife Elizabeth and three children: William, Vincent and Charity. The 
		feathers attached to the flag and shield are representative of 
		feathers(turkey, eagle, heron etc.) used by the Wicocomico people and 
		other closely related Algonquian speaking tribes. </p>
