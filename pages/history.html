		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Please be advised the following excerpts are from the book <em>
		Wicocomico Indian Nation of the Powhatan Empire - the Tapp Family Native 
		American Heritage</em> and is copyrighted by the Wicocomico Indian 
		Nation, Inc. Use of the following material without permission may result 
		in prosecution for violating copyright laws.</p>
		<p>Our intent is to trace the Wicocomico from the earliest days until 
		1719. Information concerning the Wicocomico after 1719 will not be 
		released until the Wicocomico submits petition documents to the BIA for 
		recognition. All the information has been verified from the original 
		sources that are available. Speculation or assumptions will be stated as 
		such. </p>
		<h2>English Arrival: Scouting for a Settlement</h2>
		<p>After an earlier skirmish with the Indians at Cape Henry, the three 
		boats entered the James River on or about May 4th, 1607. After scouting 
		the river the English found a place they thought was suitable on May 
		13th 1607: an island in Pasaheagh country without native habitation. The 
		island could easily be defended and with sufficient deep water near the 
		shore to tie down the three ships. However, nearby was a mosquito 
		infested swamp, and the water in the James turned brackish during the 
		summer months. It wasn&#39;t until later that they realized the mistake.</p>
		<h2>Captain John Smith&#39;s Exploration of the MD and VA Eastern Shore, 
		June 2 - July 21, 1608. </h2>
		<p class="style1">Passing along the coast searching every inlet and bay 
		fit for harbor and habitations...seeing many isles in the midst of the 
		bay, we bore up for them. But ere we could obtain them, such an extreme 
		gust of wind, rain, thunder, and lighting happened that with great 
		danger we escaped unmerciful raging of that ocean like water. The 
		highest land on the main, yet it was but low, we called Keale&#39;s Hill, 
		and these uninhabited isles Russell&#39;s Isles. </p>
		<p class="style1">The next day, searching for fresh water, we could find 
		none; the defect whereof forced us to follow the next eastern channel, 
		which brought us to the WIGHCOCOMOCO. The people at first with great 
		fury seemed to assault us, yet at last with songs and dances and much 
		mirth became very tractable. But searching their habitations for water, 
		we could fill but three barricoes, and that such puddle (muddy water) 
		that never till then we ever knew the want of water. We digged in and 
		searched in many places, but before two days were expired we would have 
		refused two barricoes of gold for one of that puddle water of 
		WIGHCOCOMOCO. </p>
		<p class="style1">From <em>The Generall Historie of Virginia, 
		New-England, and the Summer Isles</em> by Capt John Smith.</p>
		<p>Smith&#39;s exploration took place in what we know today as Maryland and 
		Virginia, on the east side of Chesapeake Bay. In Maryland Smith 
		encountered the Maryland Wicocomico. Based on recent research, the 
		Maryland Wicocomico and Virginia Wicocomico may be connected. This 
		possibility is discussed in later chapters.</p>
		<h2>Captain Smith&#39;s Second Expedition: Virginia Shore July 24 - 
		September 7, 1608. </h2>
		<p class="style1">In the discovery of the Rappahannock River, they were 
		kindly received by the people of Maraughacund. Here they met an old 
		friend and acquaintance, one MOSCO, a lusty INDIAN OF WIGHCOCOMOCE 
		(WICOCOMICO)on the River Patomack (Potomac). They supposed him some 
		Frenchman&#39;s son because of his thick black bushy beard, and the Indians 
		seldom have any at all. And he was not a little proud of this, and to 
		see so many of his countrymen. He was very offcious and useful to the 
		English; they advised them by all means not to pass over to Rappahanocks 
		who would certainly kill them for being friends with the Maraughacunds, 
		who had lately stolen three of their King&#39;s women. But thinking, he only 
		said this to secure their trade to his friends, they crossed the river 
		to the Rappahanocks.There under the pretence of trade, they were invited 
		up to Rappahanock Creek, where they had laid an ambush, and after a 
		smart skirmish in which many Indians were slain and wounded, the English 
		came off the victors without the least hurt. Having driven them into the 
		woods, they seized three or four canoes, full of commodities, which with 
		some arrows, they ahd gathered up, they presented to MOSCO for his 
		kindness. Under he on his part, received them in the most triumphant 
		manner,and in martial Order Under Arms, that he could procure of the 
		Maraughaacunds. </p>
		<p class="style1">From <em>The Generall Historie of Virginia, 
		New-England, and the Summer Isles</em> by Capt John Smith.</p>
		<p>During Capt Smith&#39;s second expedition, he mentions the Wighcocomoco 
		of Virginia, being located on the Patawomek River (Potomac River). The 
		actual location of the Wicocomico village was at the end and slightly 
		north of the Little Wicomico River. According to Stephen Potter, the 
		Wicocomico King&#39;s village was at the end and slightly north of the 
		Little Wicomico River and his subjects had a village close to the mouth 
		and south of the Little Wicomico called Cinquck. This is the first 
		mention of the Wicocomico. </p>
		<p>One has to question the validity of this expedition being his first 
		on the shores of Virginia. His comments about meeting &quot;Mosco&quot; an old 
		friend from the Wighcocomoco tends to imply they were acquainted before, 
		indication that he had made some type of trip through the area prior to 
		this expedition. </p>
		<p>Smith also mentioned that Mosco was thought to be part French because 
		of his thick black beard. I personally believe that Mosco is part 
		Spanish. One has to keep in mind that the Spanish were in the area in 
		1525 and later. My personal thoughts on the influence of the Spanish in 
		the area will be discussed in a separate chapter. </p>
		<p>The following is an excerpt from the &quot;History of the Discovery and 
		Settlement of Virginia&quot; by William Stith one of the Governors of William 
		and Mary College. </p>
		<p class="style1">At this time also Captain Raleigh Croshaw was in the 
		Patowmack River (Potomac River) trading in a small bark, commanded by 
		Capt Spilman. There an Indian stole aboard and told them of the 
		massacre, (1622) and that Opechancanough had been practicing with his 
		King and Country to betray them, which they refused to do, but that the 
		Indians of WIGHCOCOMOCO ( WICOCOMICO) had undertaken it. Hereon Captain 
		Spilman went thither, but they feeling his men so vigilant and well 
		armed, suspected themselves to be discovered, therefore, the better to 
		colour their guilt, and delude him, they gave him such satisfaction in 
		his trade, that his vessel was soon near loaded. </p>
		<p>To sum it up, the WIGHCOCOMOCO (Wicocomico) were turned in by some 
		unknown Indian, in turn Spilman went to the Wighcocomoco camp. The 
		Wighcocomoco understood that they were suspect of planning to 
		participate in the 1622 uprising. They traded so well with Spilman, 
		preventing an attack on their village. </p>
		<p>The following paragraph (William Strachey 1609-1612) discusses the 
		Wighcocomoco and the population of the Wighcocomoco and other tribes on 
		the Potomac River. </p>
		<p class="style1">&quot;The fourth river is called Patawomeck (Potomac) and 
		we called it Elizabeth River, and is six or seven miles breadth. It is 
		navigable 120 miles, and is fed as the rest with many sweet rivers and 
		springs which fall from the bordering hills. Many of them are planted 
		and yield no less plenty and variety fo fruit than the other rivers. It 
		exceedeth with abundance of fish, and is inhabited on both side: First 
		on the south side at the very entrance is the WIGHCOCOMOCO,and which 
		hath 130 fighting men; beyond that is Cekakawon with 30 men; then 
		Onawmanient with 100 men; then Patawomeck with 160 able men&quot;. </p>
		<p>Several formulas were developed by historians to determine the 
		population of a village. some used a multiplier of 3 1/2, others used 4. 
		The most common multiplier used for the Wighcocomoco, was 4, making the 
		total tribal strength at 520. the Wighcocomoco was one of the largest 
		tribes in Virginia at that time. </p>
		<h2>Wighcocomoco, 1650 TO 1719 </h2>
		<p>The 1622 incident concerning the confrontation with the Wighcocomoco 
		Tribe is the last mention of the Wighcocomoco until Northumberland 
		become a county in 1648. Previously the area of the Wicocomico Indians 
		remained in the hands of local Indians, although there were excursions 
		by the English into the area. After the English discovered the potential 
		of the area, they immediately annexed the area as Northumberland County. 
		The original boundaries were located between the Potomac and the 
		Rappahannock Rivers and the western boundaries were open for expansion 
		in the future. In 1651 Lancaster County was formed from a section of 
		Northumberland. </p>
		<p>The Virginia General Assembly passed a law in 1652 that authorized 50 
		acres per bowman. Northumberland County complied with this order by 
		directing, Machymap ( Werowance of the Cekacawon and Wicocomico 
		Indians.) to have his land surveyed. This indicates that sometimes 
		between 1652 and 1655 the previously separate tribes (Wicocomico and 
		Cekacawon) were directed by the Northumberland Assembly, to merge as one 
		single entity. Also during this period both tribes were relocated to the 
		south of the Great Wicoccomico River, whereas previously the Cekacawon 
		were located near the Coan River and the Wicocomico at the end and 
		slightly north of the Little Wicomico. </p>
		<p>The survey in 1655/56 by Gervais Dodson surveyed 4,400 acres near 
		Dividing Creek for the merged tribes. There is a strong possibility the 
		Cuttatawomen Tribe merged with the Wicocomico and Cekacawon between 
		1656/59 (Helen Rountree). Supposedly the Cuttatawomen were reported to 
		have been moving toward the north in the direction of the Wicocomico at 
		their new lands. The Cuttatawomen as a tribe dropped out of existence 
		and were never heard of again. </p>
		<p>Machywap was selected as the Werowance ( by the English) of the 
		combined Wicocomico and Cekacawon, because he was considered a friend 
		and easy to manage. This selection did not go well with the Wicocomico, 
		they wanted their person as the leader.The conflict was so great that 
		Machywap&#39;s life was threatened to the point that the English had to 
		provide protection for him. By 1660 the merged tribes were called the 
		Wicocomico and settled in their new lands of 4,400 acres. However this 
		did not last long, shortly after the Wicocomico were relocated, their 
		new lands were being encroached on by the English, supposedly Samuell 
		Mathewes( former governor) had previously been issued a grant for the 
		same land that had been surveyed for the Wicocomico.Between 1660 and 
		1673 the whites and the Wicocomico were constantly in court battling 
		over land disputes. Finally in 1673 the disputes were resolved in favor 
		of the Wicocomico and the 1655 boundaries reestablished. However, even 
		though the disputes were in favor of the Wicocomico, by 1719 
		approximately 1,700 of the 4,400 acres were left, the land had been 
		given out as grants by the English even though the Wicocomico had been 
		forced to relocate from their original ancestral near the Little 
		Wicocomico River in 1652. </p>
		<p>Begining with Machywap, the Northumberland Commissioners(1655 to 
		1719)appointed the successors to the position of Werowance. However the 
		Wicocomico refused to cooperate. Pewem apparently was selected by the 
		tribe as Chief, however the English did not recognize him as such and 
		addressed him as &quot;Great Man&quot;. With this control by the county 
		commissioners and the law passed by the English that stated that if a 
		tribe deserted their lands the English could move in and confiscate the 
		land; these two acts effectively destroyed the tribes as an independent 
		political entity. </p>
		<p>The last recognized colonial Tribal Chief was &quot;King William Taptico&quot;.(visit 
		our &quot;Chief&quot; web page for known list of Wicocomico Tribal Chiefs). 
		Willian died in 1719; after his death, his wife, Elizabeth settled his 
		estate. At the onset of settling William&#39;s estate, Elizabeth began the 
		process by signing the documentation as &quot;Elizabeth Taptico and completed 
		the process by signing &quot;Elizabeth Tapp&quot;. </p>
		<p>This is the beginning of the Native American Tapps.</p>
		<p>Current Wicocomico family names are Taptico/Tapp, Veazey/Vesey, Mosco, 
		Nordas, Roberts and possibly Curtis.</p>
		<h2>Images</h2>

		<img align="right" alt="Two Wicocomico men creating a canoe." height="172" hspace="5" src="../images/canoe.jpg" width="309" />The 
		area inhabited by tribes of the Powhatan Empire depended on the 
		waterways for transportation and some of their food supplies. The most 
		popular method of transportation was the canoe. A fire was built around 
		the base of a tree to weaken the tree and then toppled. After the limbs 
		were trimmed, a fire was built on the log to char the area that was to 
		be dug out. The primary tool used for the removal of charred wood was a 
		large shell. </p>
		<p>
		<img align="right" alt="Two women in traditional dress." height="174" hspace="5" src="../images/2w.jpg" width="308" />Image 
		two represents the type of clothes worn by women. The apron type apparel 
		consisted of various materials, depending on the wealth of the person. 
		Aprons were made of animal hides and various grasses(called silk grass). 
		Normally, the women were bare from the waist up, other than adornments 
		of some type. Hair styles varied from tribe to tribe, some wore bangs, 
		others cut their hair to ear level, others wore their hair pulled back. 
		Again it depended on the tribe affiliation. </p>
		<p>
		<img align="right" alt="Image showing how mothers cared for their infant children." height="208" hspace="5" src="../images/wandc.jpg" width="362" />Image 
		three indicate how the mothers carried their children and was described 
		by Robert Beverley in his book &quot;The History And Present State of 
		Virginia&quot;, written in 1705 and is one of the earliest comprehensive 
		works done. According to Beverley, the children were kept on a hard 
		board until their bones begin to harden. They were removed and allowed 
		to play, but most of the time was spent on the board. Another custom 
		that was foreign to the English; each morning the child was dipped in 
		cold water. </p>
		<p>The images are generic and are considered to be the type of clothing 
		and other every day activities practiced by the tribes of the Powhatan 
		Confederacy. The images are etchings by De Bry, sometimes in the earlier 
		1600s. The coloring was added recently. </p>
		<h2>TAPTICO-TAPP </h2>
		<p>This section gives a brief history outline of the connection between 
		King William Taptico and the Tapps, included is the first four 
		generations of William Taptico and when they begin using the name Tapp.</p>
		<p>After King William Taptico, the last hereditary Tribal Chief of the 
		Wicocomico died, the English did not appoint a successor, nor did a 
		descendant of Taptico take over reign of the tribe. Taptico&#39;s wife 
		Elizabeth, settled his estate, (which was substantial) and began the 
		process by signing the documents as Elizabeth Taptico,and completed the 
		process by signing Elizabeth Tapp.This appears to be the period in time 
		when the Indian Tapps came into being.Currently we do not have proof if 
		Elizabeth was English or Indian. The book,&quot;Tapp Family of America&quot; 
		stated that she was English but did not offer proof. During this period 
		it was against English law for Indians and whites to marry, so there is 
		doubt that Elizabeth was English. </p>
		<p>1. WILLIAM TAPPTICO I was born sometimes in the 1650s in 
		Northumberland County VA and died after November 1695, most likely in 
		Northumberland County VA. WILLIAM I married Elinder ? date unknown in 
		Northumberland County VA. We can not determine Elinder&#39;s surname or 
		where she was born, she most likely died in Northumberland VA. They had 
		only one proven child. William Taptico II (Recent research may have 
		revealed another son , George Taptico, however the relationship is 
		speculation, but very possible).</p>
		<p>2. WILLIAM TAPTICO II born about 1690 in Northumberland County VA and 
		died June 1719 in Northumberland County VA. WILLIAM II married Elizabeth 
		? date unknown and most likely in Northumberland County VA. and died 
		about 1724 in Spotslvania VA. Shorly after her husband&#39;s death Elizabeth 
		began using the surname Tapp; at this point in time the children will be 
		referred to as Tapp.</p>
		<p>They had three children. William Tapp III, Charity Tapp, Vincent Tapp.
		</p>
		<p>3. WILLIAM TAPP III born about 1707,Richmond County VA,died January 
		1791 Culpeper County VA. Married Christian Bourne about 1725 in VA.She 
		was born about 1708 in Essex County VA. and died about 1780 in Fredrick 
		County VA. They had eight/nine children. Vincent , William , Lewis , Ann 
		, Alice (Alse) , Elizabeth , Sarah , Mary.( Recently one our members 
		stated that William III had nine children which is supposedly Margaret. 
		Until proven this is an assumption) CHARITY TAPP born about 1709, 
		Richmond County VA, married BARTHOLEMEW WOOD,about 1724. VINCENT TAPP 
		born about 1714, Richmond County VA,died about 1751,Fredrick Co.VA 
		Married Elizabeth Bourne about 1735 in VA. She was born in VA and died 
		in VA. </p>
		<p>4. VINCENT TAPP( William Tapp III , William Taptico II , William 
		Taptico I) born about 1726 Culpepper County Virginia . Died about 
		January 17, 1791 Culpepper County Virginia, Married Mary (Mollie)Jett 
		about 1754, Virginia. She was born (Unknown) They had eleven children. 
		Moses , William , Vincent , James H , Nimrod , Elias , Sussana , John , 
		Ann , Molly , Sally. </p>
		<p>The above lineage is verified and will give the visitor a good solid 
		foundation to start his/her research. </p>
		<p>Extant records of Northumberland County VA indicate that other 
		Wicocomico family names are, Veazey, Curtis, Mosco, Nordas, and possibly 
		Roberts. </p>
		<p>Other major family lines in the earlier Taptico/Tapp lineage are; 
		Bourne, Dogget, Fowler, Boch, Jett, and Wright.&nbsp; </p>
