		<h2>NATIVE AMERICAN GENOCIDE </h2>
		<p>TRAIL OF DEATH: after years of researching the Wicocomico Nation, it 
		has led me to various other sources of study concerning the brutality 
		that Native Americans suffered at the hands of the English and later the 
		United States. These stories will not be found in our history books and 
		if by some chance one is found in the history books, it will be written 
		so that it would be difficult to realize it was the same story. Our 
		children were brought up on the story of Pocohantas and how 
		understanding the English were. </p>
		<p>When stories of this nature are read, many people try to make excuses 
		for the brutality that was imposed on the Native Americans. Many readers 
		will mention the atrocities the Native Americans imposed on the English 
		and citizens of the United States. KEEP IN MIND THIS LAND BELONGED TO 
		THE NATIVE AMERICANS; they reacted just as any citizen would in defense 
		of their land and family. </p>
		<p>When Indians came in contact with the Europeans (Spanish, French, 
		English) it was a disaster for the Indians in the form of out right 
		slaughter, or through diseases which the Indians were not immune to. I 
		believe that is sufficient enough to make the Indians wary of the 
		Europeans. </p>
		<p>When the English arrived to settle Jamestown, Chief Powhatan fed and 
		kept the English alive, however after a short time it was evident the 
		intent of the English was to steal the land in any manner possible. </p>
		<h3>MILITARY CAMPAIGN AGAINST POWHATAN </h3>
		<p>During the summer of 1610 in Jamestown, the Governor, Thomas West De 
		la Warr had directed Powhatan to return several runaway Englishman. It 
		appears Powhatan did not respond in a satisfactory manner. De la Warr 
		felt this was sufficient reason to conduct a military campaign against 
		Powhatan. George Percy, brother to the Earl of Northumberland and De la 
		Warr&#39;s second in command headed up the military action against Powhatan. 
		The following is Percy&#39;s description of the actions that took place:</p>
		<p class="style1">Drawing my soldiers into battle, placing a Captain or 
		Lieutenant at every file, we marched towards the Indian Town...and then 
		we fell upon them, put some fifteen or sixteen to the sword and almost 
		the rest to flight...My Lieutenant brought with him the Queen and her 
		children and one Indian prisoner for which I taxed him because he had 
		spared them. His answer was that having them now in custody I might do 
		with them what I pleased. Upon the same I caused the Indians head to be 
		cut off, then dispersed my files, appointing my soldiers to burn their 
		houses and to cut down their corn growing about the town. With the 
		Indians dead or dispersed, their village destroyed, and their food 
		supplies laid to waste, Percy sent out another raiding party to the the 
		same to another Indian Town and then marched to his boats with the Queen 
		and her children in tow. There, however his soldiers &quot;did begin to 
		murmur because the Queen and her children were spared.&quot; This seemed a 
		reasonable complaint to Percy, so he called a council together and &quot;it 
		was agreed upon to put the children to death THE WHICH WAS EFFECTED BY 
		THROWING THEM OVERBOARD, SHOOTING OUT THEIR BRAINS IN THE WATER.&quot; Upon 
		his return to Jamestown, however, Percy was informed that Governor De la 
		Warr was unhappy with him because he had not yet killed the Queen. 
		Advised by his chief Lieutenant that it would be best to burn her alive, 
		Perry instead decided to end his day of &quot;so much bloodshed&quot; with a final 
		act of mercy: instead of burning her, he had the queen quickly killed by 
		stabbing her to death.</p>
		<h3>&nbsp;JAMESTOWN LEGISLATION AGAINST THE INDIANS </h3>
		<p>In 1623, the Jamestown Colonists passed legislation that indicated 
		their hostility toward the Indians. The following acts are those that 
		deal with the Indians:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Act 23: &quot; that every dwelling house shall be pallizaded in for 
			defence against the Indians.</li>
			<li>Act 24: &quot;that no man go or send abroad without a sufficient 
			party well armed.</li>
			<li>Act 25: &quot;that men go not to work in the ground with out their 
			arms (and a centenell upon them).</li>
			<li>Act 26: &quot;that the inhabitants go not aboard ships or upon any 
			other occasions in such numbers, as thereby to weaken and endanger 
			the plantations.</li>
			<li>Act 27: &quot;that the commander of every plantation take care that 
			there be sufficient powder and ammunition within the plantation 
			under his command and their pieces fixt and their arms complete.</li>
			<li>Act 29: &quot;that no commander of any plantation do either him-selfe 
			or suffer others to spend powder unnecessarily in drinking or 
			entertainments.</li>
			<li>Act 32:&quot;that at the beginning of July next the inhabitants of 
			every corporation shall fall upon their adjoining savages, as we did 
			last year, those that shall be hurt upon services, to be cured at 
			the public charge; in case any to be lamed to be maintained by the 
			country according to his person and quality. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Finally in 1655 the legislatures first act for that session was to 
		pass an Act in the Indians favor. The Assembly admitted they were harsh 
		on the Indians and they had attacked the white man to protect their land 
		and way of life. The first Act: for every eight wolves heads the Indian 
		brought in, the Great Man would receive a cow. The second Act: if the 
		Indian families would bring in their children to live with a white 
		family, the children would be educated and civilized and not be used as 
		slaves. The third Act: it addressed the Indians land in that he could 
		not bargin away his land to an Englishman without the permission of the 
		Assembly, and his land was protected from unfair seizure. </p>
		<p>Based on the treatment the English inflicted on the Powhatans when 
		they arrived in 1608,the colonists, after the Revolutionary War 
		continued the same methods that had served the English so well as 
		indicated in the following stories as the United States moved west. </p>
		<h3>SAND CREEK MASSACRE (SE COLORADO). </h3>
		<p>In 1864 Col Chivington (a former clergyman that had political 
		ambitions) was appointed the territorial military commander in Colorado. 
		After some isolated incidents with the Indians, Chivington sent out 
		detachments to burn and destroy Indian villages, the Cheyenne, Arapahos, 
		Sioux, Kiowa&#39;s, and Comanches&#39;s struck back. this give Chivington the 
		opportunity that he was looking for, to launch a full scale attack on 
		the Indians. </p>
		<p>On November 29, 1864, Chivington deployed his command, about seven 
		hundred solders with howitzers around Black Kettle&#39;s village on Sand 
		Creek. Black Kettle was under the impression that he was at peace with 
		the Americans; he ran up the American Flag and assured his people that 
		all was well. the troops opened fire and charged. The Indians scattered 
		in all directions. Chivington had made it clear that he wanted no 
		prisoners, hie policy was &quot;to kill and scalp all, little and big&quot;. Nits 
		make lice he was fond of saying. Interpreter John Smith later testified: 
		they were scalped, their brains knocked out; the men used their knives, 
		ripped open women, clubbed little children, knocked them in the head 
		with their guns, beat their brains out, mutilated their bodies in every 
		sense of the word. Two hundred Cheyenne&#39;s, two thirds of them women and 
		children perished. Nine chiefs died, however Chief Black Kettle escaped. 
		(Only to be murdered later by Custer.) </p>
		<h3>L. Frank Baum</h3>
		<p>About a week prior to the slaughter at Wounded Knee, L. Frank Baum, 
		editor of South Dakota&#39;s Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer newspaper advocated 
		the extermination of all America&#39;s Indians:</p>
		<p class="style1">The nobility of the Redskin is extinguished and what 
		few are left are a pack of whining curs who lick the hand that smites 
		them. The whites by law of conquest, by justice of civilization, are 
		masters of the American continent, and the best safety of the frontier 
		settlements will be secured by the total annihilation of the few 
		remaining Indians.(WHY NOT ANNIHILATION?) Their glory has fled, their 
		spirit broken, their manhood effaced, better they should die than live 
		the miserable wretches that they are. -- L. FRANK BAUM (LATER BECOMES 
		FAMOUS AS THE AUTHOR OF &quot;THE WIZARD OF OZ&quot;) </p>
		<h3>WOUNDED KNEE </h3>
		<p>An Indian named American Horse, who had been friendly to the American 
		troops for years gave this narrative of the slaughter at Wounded Knee:</p>
		<p class="style1">...they turned their guns, Hotchkiss guns upon the 
		women who were in the lodges standing there under a flag of truce, and 
		of course as soon as they were fired upon they fled...There was a women 
		with an infant in her arms who was killed as she almost touched the flag 
		of truce, and the women and children of course were strewn all along the 
		circular village until they were dispatched. Right near the flag of 
		truce a mother was shot down with her infant; the child not knowing that 
		its mother was dead was still nursing, and that especially was a very 
		sad sight. The women as they were fleeing with their babies were killed 
		together, shot right through, and the women who were heavy with child 
		were also killed...After most of them had been killed a cry was made 
		that all those who were not killed or wounded should come forth and they 
		would be safe. Little boys who were not wounded came out of their places 
		of refuge, and as soon as they came in sight, a number of soldiers 
		surrounded them and butchered them there... Of course it would have been 
		alright if only the men were killed; we would feel almost grateful for 
		it. But the fact of the killing of the women and more especially of the 
		of the young boys and girls who are to go to make up the future of the 
		Indian people, is the saddest part of the whole affair and we feel it 
		very sorely.</p>
		<p>Shortly after the massacre, L. Frank Baum stated his approval, in the 
		&quot;Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer&#39;s paper stating that: &quot;we had better, in 
		order to protect our civilization, follow it up and wipe these untamed 
		and untamable creatures from the face of the earth.&quot; </p>
		<h3>NEW ENGLAND COLONY </h3>
		<p>On May 26th 1635 in Connecticut, Captain John Mason with his 
		Massachusetts-Connecticut force of ninty men and eighty Mohegans and 500 
		Narragansett Indians planned to attack the Pequot with the intent to 
		completly wipe the town out. Mason and his militia struck in the 
		predawn. Mason instructed his men to not take any prisoners. When the 
		Mohegans and Narragansett found out about the no prisoner order they 
		refused to participate and left. Thus left to his own devices, Mason 
		ordered his miltiamen to set fire to the entire town, burning alive as 
		many as 900 &quot;women, children, and helpless old men. Those who tried to 
		escape the blaze were cut down with swords and axes. As Plymouth 
		Governor William Bradford later described the scene, paraphrasing 
		Mason&#39;s own exultant account: </p>
		<p class="style1">It was a fearful sight to see them thus frying in the 
		fire and the streams of blood quenching the same, and horrible was the 
		stink and scent thereof; but the victory seemed a sweet sacrifice, and 
		they gave the praise thereof to God, who had wrought so wonderfully for 
		them, thus to enclose their enemies in their hands and give them so 
		speedy a victory over so proud and insulting an enemy. </p>
		<p>The new England Colony made the Virginia Colonists look like a group 
		of saints. Indians normally fought out of revenge, to steal women or 
		slaves, but very seldom slaughtered women and children and old men for 
		land. </p>
		<hr />
		<p>What has been disclosed on this site is only the tip of the iceberg, 
		broken treaties and promises are part of the Native Americans everyday 
		vocabulary. </p>
		<p>I&#39;m sure some folks that read this page will feel uncomfortable, 
		however that was not the intent. If we forget the past, it will make a 
		circle and repeat it&#39;s self. It&#39;s also important for people to know the 
		truth not only one side, but both. I believe a reader will now 
		understand why the Native American feels strongly about their 
		reservations and treaties with the government. In some parts of the 
		country the Native American did not have voting privileges as late as 
		the 1960s, so for them the past is not in the 1800s, but just a few 
		short years ago. </p>
		<p>The Native American is not looking for sympathy, but justice; if any 
		one wants to keep informed of Native American problems, you can go on 
		the internet <a href="http://www.indiancountry.com/">
