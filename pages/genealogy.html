		<p>BEFORE we begin our narrative on our heritage, I would like to 
		dedicate the following story (author unknown) to our Tribe. The contents 
		of this story tells about the storyteller&#39;s feeling and is in the best 
		tradition of all Native Americans ability to carry on tribal tradition 
		through story telling and keeping their heritage alive. </p>
		<p>We are the chosen! My feelings are in each family there is one who 
		seems called to find the ancestors, to put flesh on their bones and make 
		them live again, to tell the family and tribal story and to feel that 
		somehow they know and approve. To me doing genealogy is not a cold 
		gathering of facts but instead, breathing life into all who have gone 
		before. We are the story tellers of the tribe! All tribes have one! We 
		have been called as it were by our Native American genes. Those who have 
		gone before us cry out to us; tell our story. So we do. </p>
		<p>In finding them, we somehow find ourselves. How many graves have I 
		stood before now and cried? I have lost count. How many times have I 
		told our ancestors, you have a wonderful family, you would be proud of 
		us. How many times have I walked up to a grave and felt somehow there 
		was love there for me? I cannot say. </p>
		<p>It goes beyond just documenting facts, it goes to who I am and why do 
		I do the things I do. It&#39;s about seeing a cemetery about to be lost 
		forever to weeds and indifference and saying, I can&#39;t let this happen. 
		The bones are bones of my bone and flesh of my flesh. It&#39;s doing 
		something about it. It&#39;s about pride in what our ancestors were able to 
		accomplish, how they contributed to what we are today. It&#39;s about 
		respecting their hardships and losses, their never giving in or giving 
		up, their determination to go on and build a life for their family. </p>
		<p>It was a deep pride that they fought to make us a Nation. It was a 
		deep and immense understanding that they were doing it for us, that we 
		might be born who we are, that we might remember them. So we do. With 
		love and caring and scribing each fact of of their existence, because we 
		are them and they are us. So as a scribe called, I tell the story of our 
		tribe and family. </p>
		<p>That is why I do my family genealogy, and that is what calls those 
		young and old to step up and put flesh on their bones. </p>
		<hr />
		<p>What I will attempt to do is present a theory (based on various 
		documents) on how the English Tapp&#39;s and how the Native American Tapp&#39;s 
		were intermingled. To do this I used the Tapps that were presented in 
		the Tapp Family Book by Lile, fulcher and Tapp. This book is very 
		inaccurate and should never be used as a research guide. However the 
		Tapps the book mentioned are real but not listed accurately. These Tapps 
		were before 1719,the date our Native American Tapps came into being. ( 
		When Elizabeth Taptico changed the name to Tapp upon William Taptico&#39;s 
		death). It&#39;s close to being fact that this is the first concise bit of 
		information that is available prior to 1719. </p>
		<p>First, we do not have proof that Thomas Tapp married Mary Lewis, 
		however we do have evidence that a Mary Tapp married a John Butcher, 
		this has been assumed by the Liles Fulcher Tapp book that this was the 
		widow of Thomas Tapp. </p>
		<p>ACCORDING TO THE TAPP FAMILY BOOK </p>
		<p>Thomas Tapp b@ 1628 d @ May 18, 1689, married Mary Lewis by 1655, b @ 
		1636 d after 1691. </p>
		<p>CHILDREN: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>John Tapp b @ 1656 married Jane Fullerton. ( Ajohn Tapp rented 
			150 acres in New Kent County in 1704...probably John Jr. His son 
			John Jr was named in the will of Jane Fullerton. </li>
			<li>Henry Tapp Information not available. </li>
			<li>William Tapp b @ 1664 married Elinor Jones by 1689.This is 
			suposedly the father of King William Taptico. </li>
			<li>Mary Tapp b @ 1670 d September 10,1731 or Jan 16, 1726, married 
			Joseph Bragg. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>We will state some facts and then list the sources. According to all 
		extant records available, Thomas and Mary had one child. JOHN, can be 
		identified thru various order book entry&#39;s that will be listed, later.
		</p>
		<p>HENRY can not be found, there was a Henry Tapp listed in Assembly of 
		the VA council in 1850s, however he would be to old to be the son of 
		Thomas and Mary. This is speculation on my part that he is most likely 
		part of the English Tapps, but again this is speculation. </p>
		<p>WILLIAM TAPP, did not exist as a son of Thomas and Mary, nothing was 
		found in the existing records to make one believe that a William Tapp 
		did exist. The Tapp family book stated that the name William Tapp and 
		William Taptico were interchangable, not so. From 1693, William I thru 
		William Taptico II, the name was listed in the order books as William 
		Taptico or Tapticoe. One entry was found that appeared to read William 
		Tapp, however the entry appeared to have part of the wording torn off. 
		One must keep in mind, that these entrys are copies of original records 
		of 400 years ago. </p>
		<p>MARY TAPP, was not a daughter, but a daughter in-law, again the 
		entry&#39;s to prove this will be listed below. </p>
		<p>First I will discuss John Tapp and the discrepancies listed in the 
		Tapp book. The following is the will of Jane Fullerton: </p>
		<p class="style1">&quot;In the name of God Amen, I JOANE FULLERTON of ye 
		county of Rappae: in ye yeare of or: Lord 1678 being very sick of body 
		but of a sound &amp; perfect memory, God be praised for it, doe make this my 
		last Will &amp; Testamt. as followeth; first I bequeath my soule into ye 
		hands of ye Almihgty God hoping for remission of all my sinns.&quot; </p>
		<p class="style1">Item: I bequeath my body to ye Earth to buried in a 
		decent manner. </p>
		<p class="style1">Item: I give &amp; bequeath as followth: one cow called 
		Pie, unto Elizabeth Meades. </p>
		<p class="style1">Item: I give &amp; bequeath unto &quot;JOHN TOPP JUNIOR&quot;one cow 
		called Muge. </p>
		<p class="style1">Item: I give &amp; bequeath one black mare unto Thomas 
		Cunniers. </p>
		<p class="style1">Item: I give &amp; bequeath all ye rest of my worldly 
		goods estate unto Robert Doewell. </p>
		<p class="style1">Item: I give &amp; bequeath one gold ring unto Samll. 
		Parry juinor. </p>
		<p class="style1">And this I make to be my last Will and Testamt. &amp; all 
		other Will or Wills to be void &amp; no effect. As Witness my hand &amp;Seale 
		this 14th of Aprill 1678. Signed &amp; Sealed in ye presence of us. 
		Sammll.Parry, Humphrey Perkins....................Joane (Her Mark) 
		Fullerton. </p>
		<p>The deposition of Humphrey Perkins &amp; Samll. Perry say that they did 
		see ye above nmed Joane Fullerton signe seal &amp; publish ye above 
		mencjoned as her last Will and Testamt. &amp; that she was in perfect 
		silence &amp; memory at ye signing. Sealing &amp; publishing thereof to ye best 
		of their judgements Samll.Parry Hump. Perkins </p>
		<p>Jurati sunt PARRY et PERKINS in Cur Con Rappae: 3rd die Juli 1678 et 
		Recordatr. xx2th die. </p>
		<p>There are many questions concerning the information in The Tapp 
		Family book concerning the will of Jane or Joane Fullerton and what the 
		records reveal. We will discuss the Will before we continue with the 
		entry&#39;s from the order books. </p>
		<p>The one question that is the most important is... if this is Johns 
		wife, why did she use her maiden name ? This is most unusual. In those 
		days the wife used her married name. Based on the Rappahannock County 
		Order Books, John, her husband died sometimes in 1685, Joane or Jane 
		died in 1678, about 7 years before John, so it&#39;s not a case of Jonae or 
		Jane marrying again. Another question is the spelling John Topp. It&#39;s 
		difficult to read some of the entry&#39;s so it may have been John Tapp, but 
		not positive. Jane or Joane , in her will left all the rest of her 
		wordly goods to a Robert Doewell, why ? It would be more logical to 
		leave this to her husband John. So based on the sequence of events and 
		the will, I believe that Jane or Joane Fullerton did not have a 
		connection with John.It&#39;s my opinion that the Tapp Family book decided 
		to fill in a slot. Disregarding my opinion, evidence points to a 
		conclusion that sufficient evidence is not available to state that Jane 
		or Joane Fullerton was Johns wife. </p>
		<p>The following entry&#39;s are from the Rappahannock County Order Books. 
		And should prove that Mary is Johns wife , not a daughter of Thomas and 
		Mary. </p>
		<p>August 5, 1685: A commission of Administration is granted to MARY 
		TAPP upon the estate of her deced husband, JOHN TAPP, she giving 
		security to be accountable for the same to this Court or to whom it 
		shall more properly belong. </p>
		<p>The estate of JOHN TAPP deced and that they make report thereof under 
		their hands at the next South side Court held for this County. </p>
		<p>MARY TAPP, together with Mr. John Waters enter themselves in an 
		assumpsit of ten thousand pounds of tobb: and cask for the said MARY 
		TAPPS due administracon of the estate of her deced husband comitted to 
		her. </p>
		<p>November 4th 1685: Ordered that MARY TAPP make her personall 
		appearance at next South side Court held for this County &amp; that then &amp; 
		there, she give an exact &amp; true account oath of her deced husbands 
		estate. </p>
		<p>1686: Whereas by evidence it appears to this Court that ELIZABETH 
		TAPP, daughter of John Tapp deced, an infant, was by her Mother-in-law, 
		MARY TAP, neglected &amp; not taken care of, the Court have ordered that 
		upon this Peticon HENRY PICKETT of this County do take the sd orphan 
		under his care &amp; charge &amp; that she remaine with him untill she come to 
		the age of sixteen or day of marriage wch should first happen. </p>
		<p>MY NOTES: In those days, Mother-In-Law and Step Mother meant the 
		same. Taken in the context of the entry and the many other entry&#39;s we 
		can assume that this meant Step Mother. Therefore Elizabeth is the 
		daughter of JOHN&#39;S previous wife, but certainly not Jane or Joane 
		Fullerton. We will continue with the entry&#39;s concerning MARY TAPP &amp; JOHN 
		TAPP. </p>
		<p>August 4th, 1686: Reference granted between XPIAN PETERSON, plaintiff 
		&amp; MARY TAP, Admisistrix of her deced husband JNO. TAP, Defendant, till 
		next Court. </p>
		<p>February 1687: It is ordered that THO. GAINES take into his custody 
		the sowes &amp; hogs belonging to JOHN TAPP render an account thereof to the 
		next Court held for this County. </p>
		<p>October 6th 1687: Ordered that JOHN WATERS sometimes between this &amp; 
		the next Court, inventory &amp; appraise the estate of JOHN TAP, late deced 
		&amp; make a report thereof in his hand in writing, to the next Court for 
		this County. </p>
		<p>September, 1689: Reff. granted intr. XPIAN PETERSON, Plaintiff &amp; 
		JOSEPH BRAGG as marrying MARY TAP, Defendant, till next Court. </p>
		<p>December 5th, 1689: The Reff. Intr. XPIAN PETERSON, Plaintiff &amp; 
		JOSEPH BRAG as marrying MARY TAP, Defendant, is continued till next 
		Court. </p>
		<p>Unfortunately this is the last entry that I have found concerning 
		Mary Tap, however it&#39;s possible that John Tapp may have married a Joan 
		Fullerton, she died and he married Mary ( maiden unknown, may be 
		Waters). His daughter , that was being mistreated by his second wife 
		Mary, could have been from his first wife, Joan Fullerton. However the 
		question of Joan using her maiden name in her will is questionable and 
		the name Topp, not Tapp needs to be explained. What has been cleared up 
		is the question of Mary being listed as a daughter...we now know that 
		she was a sister-in-law, not a daughter. The Liles Fulcher Tapp book has 
		Mary listed as a daughter that married a Bragg. The second son, Henry 
		cannot be located. Thomas and Mary Lewis Tapp mayhave had a son named 
		William Tapp, however he is not the father of King William Taptico. Keep 
		in mind the Native American Tapps did not come into being until 1719, 
		when King William Taptico died his wife changed the name to Tapp. Based 
		on the above evidence, it appears the Tapps listed in the Liles Fulcher 
		Tapp are the English Tapps. If this is correct, it raises several 
		questions, did John Tap leave any male heirs ? Did Henry leave any male 
		heirs ? An interesting bit of information is that the given name of 
		Henry is only found in the Vincent Tapp family of Augusta County 
		VA...this family is thought to be English, could there be a connection. 
		[For those of you that read my genforum posting, this is the method that 
		I detest, connecting families by given names, so tear into me :o) ] </p>
		<p>The big puzzle is William Tapp, did Thomas and Mary Lewis really have 
		a son by the name of William or did the authors of the Tapp Family Book 
		find it convenient to list him in this family group. ( Remember, the 
		Tapp Family Book stated that Tapp and Taptico were interchangeable, 
		which is incorrect.) The first time that a William Tapp was mentioned 
		(other than in the Tapp Book) was as a sibling of Charity and Vincent in 
		1724. In the Northumberland Order Books there was one listing of a 
		William Tapp ( about 1690s), but it was so badly distorted it could 
		possibly have been William Taptico and it did reference a previous entry 
		of William Taptico. </p>
		<p>With so littles information available on John and Henry, it will be 
		difficult to trace this group to the Augusta family. </p>
		<p>THE next group of Tapp&#39;s that appear to be English are those that are 
		from Augusta County Virginia. In most Tapp family tree&#39;s they have this 
		family as descendants of King William Taptico. </p>
		<p>The information below is from a letter that is copyrighted and I can 
		not place it on line, however I do have permission to publish it in my 
		book &quot; THE LAST OF THE WICOCOMICO&quot; </p>
		<p>We will begin with the second son of King William Taptico and 
		Elizabeth...Vincent (sibling of William and Charity) supposedly married 
		Elizabeth Bourne, the problem is; this union is not proven and the 
		Bourne family history can not verify that the marriage took place. </p>
		<p>Vincent&#39;s children were identified in a letter written by Alice 
		Graham dated October 11, 1811 from Rockingham County Virginia. ( Alice 
		is the daughter of William Tapp who married Christian Bourne)She was 
		responding to a letter she received from Vincent Tapp of Augusta County 
		Virginia. Vincent was attempting to determine if they were related. I 
		cannot reveal any further information without breaking copyright laws.

		<p>The following is Vincent Tapp&#39;s estate inventory and appears to be 
		Williams father, Vincent. ( The one that supposedly married Elizabeth 
		Bourne). </p>

		<p>At Court held for Frederick County the 4th day of August, 1752. </p>
		<p>William Tapp is having returned into Court the appraisement of the 
		estate of Vincent Tapp, Deced the same is admitted to record </p>
		<p>Teste. T.Wood CC. </p>
		<p>Now the problems...the William that married Ann, (son of Vincent and 
		Elizabeth Bourne) is documented in Vincent and Susannah Tapp&#39;s family 
		bible, I have copies of the bible...it states the following; </p>
		<p>&quot;Vincent Tapp, son of William and Ann his wife, was born in Frederick 
		County, the 2nd day of April, 1757. Vincent married Susannah Gambill in 
		Charlottesville in the County of Albermarle, State of Virginia on the 
		24th day of June 1782&quot;. </p>
		<p>If William is the son of Vincent and Elizabeth Bourne as stated in 
		Alice Grahams letter( Alice&#39;s letter did not mention Vincents wife, this 
		is an assumption based on the Liles Fulcher Tapp Book) and the father of 
		Vincent (who married Susannah) as stated in Vincents bible, then the 
		Augusta County Tapp family are descendants of King William Taptico ! 
		However this contradicts recent information that was placed on a 
		personal web site stating that a descendent of the Fredrick County Tapps 
		had a DNA test and indicated that this family is of European origin. If 
		this is the case, it&#39;s important that the DNA tester be absolutely sure 
		that he is from this line. If his research is primarly from the Liles 
		Fulcher Tapp book then there may be a problem. </p>
		<p>What is possible, is that Alice&#39;s letter is correct, but the William 
		that married Ann is not the same William she discussed in her letter.
		</p>
		<p>October, 2004. </p>
		<p>Before I continue with my thoughts on the English Tapps, I need to 
		mention the supposedly French Tapps that arrived in Virginia in 1724 and 
		settled in Westmoreland County VA. </p>
		<p>The following is from the Liles Fulcher Tapp Book. </p>
		<p>Phillip Lewis Joseph Tapp (1690) was the &quot;founder&quot; of this Tapp 
		Family in the Colony of Virginia. Born in Montauban, France, he arrived 
		in Virginia in 1724, settling in Westmoreland County. He evidently 
		brought his then children with him, as records show some of them born in 
		Montauban, France. </p>
		<p>The book states that Phillip Lewis Jopseph Tapp married Louise 
		Desplain, their childeran are; </p>
		<p>Phillip Lewis Joseph Tapp Jr b. in Mountauban France. Married 
		Fauntleroy. </p>
		<p>Anna Maria Tapp 3/20/1716 b. in Mountaban France. Married William 
		Bledsoe. </p>
		<p>Frederick William Tapp b. 1720, Orange County Virginia.Married Rachel 
		Mountjoy. </p>
		<p>MY NOTES: The Liles Fulcher Tapp is very inaccurate, but they had to 
		find these names somewhere. I will be contacting a researcher in 
		Westmoreland and see if this family existed, also I will contact the 
		French Embassy and find the address of the archives in Paris. Until we 
		find this familes place in the overall Tapp genealogy, we will be 
		spinning our wheels and continue misplacing the Tapps in the wrong 
		ethnic group. </p>
		<p>I had a researcher check out this family several months ago, he did 
		find some of the names listed as descendants but did not find the 
		conncection, also the Tapp Book mentions a Fielding Lewis Tapp (grandson 
		of of Phillip Lewis Joseph Tapp) as marrying a Mildred Chowning. ( Some 
		folks have stated that Chowning and Chewning is the one and same ! 
		WRONG. Chewinig is documented and I have the lineage of Lewis and 
		Mildred Chowning. By the way, Fielding is not Lewis&#39;s first name, it 
		appears someone added Fielding to give readers the impression that he 
		may be related to, Fielding Lewis, ancestor/descendant of George 
		Washington and his family. </p>
