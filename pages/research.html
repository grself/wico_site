		<h2>RESEARCH AND STUDY SITE </h2>
		<p>The purpose of our research site is to put forth new ideas, theories, 
		speculation and articles that in some way may reflect or connect to the 
		Wicocomico Indian Nation and the Powhatan Empire. At no time will we 
		attempt to analyze the Indians mind 400 hundred years later, we will 
		deal in facts that may lead to an intelligent conclusion or theory. The 
		problem today is that many historians try to reconstruct the Indian&#39;s 
		mind set based on the training they received in today&#39;s world, this is 
		not the way to build a solid base of past history. The prehistoric 
		Indian&#39;s mind set and world view can not possibly be reconstructed by 
		contemporary white people with their mind set and world view. </p>
		<p>What is amazing is that more historians do not research contemporary 
		Native American Tribes literature, religion, folk lore, and oral history 
		to make rational conclusions concerning the past. In almost all 
		available information on contemporary Native Americans, they all have 
		many things in common, their close relationship to Mother Earth, fire, 
		water wind, the four directions, the circle, and other symbols of their 
		past. This is their culture that has been passed down from their 
		ancestors. Many of these symbols are discussed in the history written by 
		the Europeans 400-500 years ago, a clear indication that, our 
		contemporary Native American Indians continue to have a different world 
		view than the white race, a strong desire to keep and maintain their 
		heritage.</p>
		<p>The articles that we place on our site are in no way implying that 
		the subject matter is part of our history or connected to the Wicocomico 
		Indian Nation in any way, but simply stated, an area of research that 
		runs parallel with our research and subject matter may have covered 
		areas that we previously researched. </p>

		<p>The following article is submitted by Wayne Winkler, a well known 
		researcher in the origins of the &quot;Melungeons&quot; a group of people that are 
		older than America. Some of his research and theories include the role 
		and connections the Powhatan&#39;s have in Melungeon history.</p>
		<p>MULUNGEON ORIGINS &nbsp; </p>
		<p>By Wayne Winkler </p>
		<p>For more than a century, the Melungeons have been the focus of 
		anthropologists, social scientists, and (especially) feature writers for 
		newspapers and magazines. The most common adjective used to describe the 
		Melungeons is &quot;mysterious;&quot; no one seems to know where the Melungeons 
		originated. More significantly, the Melungeions did not fit into any of 
		the racial categories which define an individual or group within 
		American society, they were considered by their neighbors neither white, 
		black, nor Indian.&nbsp; </p>
		<p>The Melungeons are a group of mixed ethnic ancestry, found primarily 
		in northeastern Tennessee, southwestern Virginia, southeastern Kentucky. 
		Similar groups of &quot;mysterious&quot; people, or at least remnants of these 
		groups, are found all along the Atlantic seaboard. While these other 
		groups have no known connection to the Melungeons, they have suffered 
		similar problems due to the difficulty of placing them within an 
		established racial category. Anthropologists called them &quot;racial 
		islands&quot; or &quot;tri-racial isolates.&quot;</p>
		<p>Several surnames are associated with the Melungeons, including 
		Collins, Gibson, Goins, Mullins, Bowlin. The Melungeons have 
		historically been associated with Newmans Ridge in Hancock County, 
		Tennessee. Newspapers and magazines have found the Melungeons a 
		fascinating topic since the 1840s, but the Melungeons have resented most 
		of the publicity they have received over the years. Most of the articles 
		on the Melungeons speculated on the legends, folklore, and other 
		theories surrounding their ancestry. </p>
		<p>Some of these legends and theories have suggested descent from 
		Spanish or Portuguese explorers, from the &quot;Lost Colonists&quot; of Roanoke 
		Island, from the shipwrecked sailors or pirates of various 
		nationalities, from one of the Lost Tribes of Israel, or from ancient 
		Phoenicians or Carthaginians. More recent theories have proposed that 
		the Melungeons descended from Mediterranean or Middle Eastern ancestors.
		</p>
		<p>None of these theories originated with the Melungeons themselves. 
		Early accounts reflect the Melungeons&#39; self description as &quot;Indians.&quot; 
		Some Melungeons reportedly described themselves a Portuguese,&quot; or, as 
		many pronounced it, Portyghee.&quot;Most of their white neighbors considered 
		the Melungeons a mixture of black and Indian or white, black, and 
		Indian. </p>
		<p>There is no consistent definition of the word &quot;Melungeon.&quot; Some 
		anthropologists have limited the term to a few families located near 
		Newman&#39;s Ridge, while others have expanded &quot;Melungeon&quot; to include other 
		mixed-race groups in the southeastern United States. At one time, the 
		word was used as a racial epithet against a mullatto, at another time as 
		a political epithet for east Tennessee Republicans. The common usage of 
		the term had an element of socio-economic status attached to it; 
		families who were financially successful were not necessarily considered 
		Melungeon, no matter who their ancestors were. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;By the early 1960s, newspaper articles predicted the 
		disappearance of the Melungeons; out-migration and intermarriage with 
		whites had nearly rendered the Melungeons indistinguishable from their 
		white neighbors. However, by the end of that decade, Melungeons in 
		Hancock County were acknowledging and celebrating their heritage with an 
		outdoor drama. By the mid-1900s, a &quot;virtual community&quot; of Melungeons had 
		developed on the internet. </p>
		<p>One question which has been examined by nearly every writer on this 
		subject is the origin of the name &quot;Melungeon.&quot; The most commonly 
		accepted theory is that the word derived from the French melange, 
		meaning mixture. A French colony in southwestern Viginia in the late 
		1700s may have dubbed these people with the plural form of melange, 
		which is melangeon or melangeons, which could conceivably have been 
		corrupted to &quot;Melungeon.&quot; Another proposed theory for the origin of &quot;Melungeon&quot; 
		is the Afro-Portuguese term meaning melungo, supposedly meaning 
		shipmate.&quot; Yet another is the Greek term melan, meaning &quot;black.&quot; </p>
		<p>Author Brent Kennedy, in arguing a Trukish origin for the Melungeons, 
		maintains that &quot;Melungeons&quot; derives from the Arabic melun jinnand the 
		Turkishmelun can, both pronounced similarly to &quot; Melungeon&quot; and both 
		translated to &quot;cursed soul&quot; &quot;or one who has been abandoned by 
		God.&quot;Kennedy maintains that the Melungeons identified themselves by that 
		name. </p>
		<p>Historian C.S.Everett suggests another possible origin for the term 
		melongena, originally an Italian term related to the more modern 
		melanzane (pronounced meh lun zhen eh) which means &quot;eggplant.&quot; The 
		eggplant has a dark skin, and the term was used to describe sub-Saharan 
		Africans. </p>
		<p>Karlton Douglas and Joanne Pexxullo suggests that the word &quot;Melungeon&quot; 
		originated as the old English term &quot;malengin&quot;(singular) or &quot;malengine&quot;(plural). 
		An old copy of Webster&#39;s Dictionary defines &quot;malengine&quot; as &quot;Evil 
		machination; guile;deceit. Douglas and Pessullo write, &quot;It is well known 
		the people of Appalachia, and Melungeons in particular, used words that 
		were becoming archaic, and not much in use beyond Appalachia.&quot; </p>
		<p>Nearly everyone that has written about the Melungeons agrees that 
		they fiercely resented the name. Even in mid-20th century, to call a 
		Hancock Countian a Melungeon was to insult him. The stigma attached to 
		the name &quot;Melungeon&quot; leads most researchers to the conclusion that the 
		name was imposed upon the people, that it was not a name they ever used 
		for themselves. </p>
		<p>Most Melungeons in Hancock County lool very much like their &quot;white&quot; 
		neighbors, many of whom are quite swarthy from a lifetime of outdoor 
		work. In 1963, Brewton Berry wrote,&quot;[N]either in their culture nor their 
		economy are they distinguishable from other mountain folk. Among those 
		bearing the telltale surnames are individuals of dark complexion and 
		straight black hair...But the physical features of most of them suggest 
		no other ancestry than white.&quot; Some historic descriptions of Melungeons 
		include: </p>
		<p class="style1">They are tall, straight, well-formed people, of a dark 
		copper color...but wolly heads and other similar appendages of our 
		negro. </p>
		<p class="style1">They are swarthy complexion, with prominent cheek 
		bones, jet black hair, generally straight but at times having a slight 
		tendancy to curl, and the men have heavy black beards...Their frames are 
		well built and some of the men are fine specimens of physical manhood. 
		They are seldom fat. </p>
		<p class="style1">While some of them are swarthy and have high Indian 
		cheekbones, the mountain whites, too, often display these same 
		characteristics. Also, many of the Melungeons have light hair, blue 
		eyes, and fair skin. </p>
		<p class="style1">The color of the skin of a full-blooded, pure 
		Melungeon is a much richer brown than an Indian&#39;s skin. It is not the 
		color of a part Indian and part white, for their skin is lighter. The 
		full-blooded, pure Melungeon had more the color of a skin of a person 
		from India and Egypt. </p>
		<p>In 1946, William Gilbert presented the first comprehensive survey of 
		tri-racial groups in the U.S. He estimated that there were at least 
		50,000 person who were &quot;complex mixtures in varying degrees of white, 
		Indian, and Negro blood.&quot; </p>
		<p>Gilbert listed ten major tri-racial groups with several related 
		groups. These included: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>BRASS ANKLES and allied groups in South Carolina, including Red 
			Bones, Red Legs, Turks, Marlboro Blues and others.</li>
			<li>CAJANS and CREOLES of Alabama and Mississippi.</li>
			<li>CROATANS of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.</li>
			<li>GUINEAS of West Virginia and Maryland.</li>
			<li>ISSUES of Amherst and Rockingham Counties, Virginia.</li>
			<li>JACKSON WHITES of New York and new Jersey.</li>
			<li>MELUNGEONS the Southern Appalachians.</li>
			<li>MOORS and NANTICOKES of Delaware and New Jersey.</li>
			<li>RED BONES of Louisiana.</li>
			<li>WESORTS of southern Maryland. </li>
