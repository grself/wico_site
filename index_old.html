		<h2>WINGAPO CHESKCHAMAY ! (WELCOME ALL FRIENDS)</h2>
		<p>Please pardon our dust as we update our site. It is being redesigned 
		so it is easier to read with mobile devices. The menu links will begin 
		to work as those pages are added. We hope to finish this redesign by 
		March 1, 2012.</p>
		<h3><em>&quot;TAPTICO&quot; LAST OF THE WICOMICO</em>....</h3>
		<p>The book (approximately 380 pages) is now ready at a cost $48, which 
		includes shipping. The book is well formatted so you can easily locate your 
		ancestors. The book traces the Native American Taptico/Tapp lineage from 
		1678 to as much as the 7th generation. Those who buy the book will receive 
		all future research on the Native American Tapps free of charge. </p>
		<p>For those who buy the book and are a descendant of King William Taptico, 
		I will include a certificate that states that you are a member of the Wicomico 
		Tribe.</p>
		<p>Previously, the system that we used to identify members was cumbersome. 
		We would receive an application, and then determine if the person was a 
		descendant. With the book, people should be able to determine immediately 
		if they are descendants. In the event that you are an adopted Tapp, this 
		is not a problem. Two things that the Bureau of Indian Affairs has made 
		clear, DNA is not required and if you were adopted by a Tapp family that 
		is of Indian lineage you will be accepted. However, let me make it clear, 
		people applying for membership in the tribe must prove that they were adopted. 
		If the adoption took place in the 1880s and 1700s, adoption papers are not 
		available in most cases, so a complete lineage must be forwarded.</p>
		<p>Comments concerning the book have been favorable. To order, send your 
		request to&nbsp;
		<a href="mailto:eagleman1@localnet.com?subject=Contact from the Wico Site">
		eagleman1@localnet.com</a> 
		with your mailing address. </p>
		<h3>Chamah Netab (Welcome Friend) </h3>
		<p>We are in the process of selecting council members in order to bring 
		the tribe back to life. The Council will be structured more to the times 
		and designed to make decisions quickly. Our primary and number one project 
		will be to seek State Approval in Virginia, much of this work has already 
		been completed. We previously submitted the first book of the Wicocomico 
		History to Indian Affairs, the second book will be submitted, with a copy 
		of the first book, to the State of Virginia. </p>
		<p>Some of our previous projects included building a Culture center, issuance 
		of a stamp honoring King William Taptico, and a time capsule. We did have 
		approval erecting a monument to the Wicocomico Indians, however the selection 
		appeared to be to restrictive and only available to a few people. At the 
		time of disbanding the council, we were in the process of having a historical 
		marker placed on the road that at one time was part of the Wicocomico land. 
		We welcome any and all to apply for membership in the Wicocomico Nation.
		</p>
		<p>Take the time and browse through the site. If you are a descendant of 
		William Taptico, this will be an adventure into your past.</p>
